## Getting Started

This plugin provides two widgets,

### 1- AirPlayRoutePickerView

Its tintColor, activeTintColor and backgroundColor, can be set to suit the overall theme of application.

```
AirPlayRoutePickerView(
                tintColor: Colors.white,
                activeTintColor: Colors.white,
                backgroundColor: Colors.transparent,
              )
```


### 2- FlutterAVPlayerView

For now it supports either local file added to flutter project, or a video url.

**To play a network video for given url:**

```
FlutterAVPlayerView(
              urlString:
                  'https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/videos/butterfly.mp4',
            ),
```

**To play a local video added to the flutter project:**

```
child: FlutterAVPlayerView(
              filePath: 'assets/videos/butterfly.mp4',
            ),
```
